This repository is a learning project that demonstrates how to build a RESTful API using **FastAPI** and **MongoDB**. The project includes two CRUD applications: one for managing books (`book_crud`) and another for managing students (`students_crud`).

## Features

- **FastAPI** for building APIs
- **MongoDB** for database storage (via MongoDB Atlas)
- **Motor** for asynchronous MongoDB operations
- Environment variable management with **python-dotenv**
- CRUD operations for books and students
- Clean project structure for scalability
